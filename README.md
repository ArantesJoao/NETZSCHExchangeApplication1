# NETZSCH Exchange - Web Application

## Overview
The NETZSCH Exchange Desktop Application is a .NET Application developed as part of a technical challenge for NETZSCH. The application showcases real-time communication between a web-based platform and a desktop application. Users can input messages and observe them real-time from its desktop counterpart.

## Prerequisites
Windows and .NET

## Setup & Installation
**I sent you guys the executable file attached to the e-mail (just like I do it on the video), but if you want to run it from Visual Studio, these are the instructions! :)**

- Open the Project in Visual Studio

- Visual Studio will tipically do this automatically for you, but if necessary, restore the NuGet Packages by
``` 
Right click on the solution in the Solution Explorer > Restore NuGetPackages
``` 

- Once NuGet packages are restored, you can build and run the application directly from Visual Studio by pressing F5 or by clicking on the Start button.
